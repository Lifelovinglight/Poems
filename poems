a verdant glade of sunshine in a park
where children sing and dance upon the grass
with oily engine and hydraulic spade
is made into a sterile concrete mass

the harlequin his lover must oft spurn
by virtue of the lass's fathers hate
but do imagine harlequins surprise
when the lass served his head on silver plate

a bloody end awaits the marching man
his officer a madman at the reins
upon his heart rests ire frosted black
when he with cold steel splits commissioned veins

a fearful shadow passes in the street
the rich man gives a shriek to raise your hair
a devil from the hells has ridden out
to collect on his god-appointed share

don't bother finding your way to the hells
the path is full of kindly wizened men
whose souls are pure as whitest lilly snow
but hate like blackest iron shackles them

a will that only it's own goodness knows
can hardly other spirits comprehend
but in the throng of fallen disgraced man
this is the only will that does not bend

the iron rod that breaks the bone and can
with fury thieves and murderers control
despoils the song and laugh of brighter folk
so place in other acts apart their role

the flames upon Pandemoniums walls
a kind word from a loving woman might
quell still and offer momentary pause
to rigid spirits judging wrong and righ

the catamorphism over loving minds
reduces to transitions over time
where soul feeds state and state feeds soul anew
by self-reflection in an evals rhyme

a network rising from a body mass
of impulse in a balanced graph of things
that squirm on legs of vivid unreal light
a song traversed by resonance that sings

a song of pattern fabric intersects
when spirit vibrates through electric bone
but hatred spoils and cuts Verandis weave
by splitting from the mind her fearful gown

and by that joy the spinning spider needs
the mind both shamrock and the Indras fruit
of peace of flesh and soul for human blood
that feeds the poems of Yggdrasils root
